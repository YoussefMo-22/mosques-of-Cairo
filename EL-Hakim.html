          Location: Mosque of al-Hakim bi Amrillah (is also known as Al-Jamiʿ
          al-Anwar) The mosque is located at the beginning of al-Muizz li Din
          Allah Street, adjacent to the Fatimid northern wall of the Old City of
          Cairo in Egypt, only a few steps away from Bab al-Futuh (Gate of
          Conquest) and Bab al-Nasr (Gate of Victory). At the time of its
          construction, the mosque lay outside the brick-built walls encircling
          Fatimid Cairo, constructed by order of Jawhar al-Saqalli, the commander
          of the armies of the Fatimid caliph, al-Muizz li-Din Allah in AH 359 -
          AD 970. In AH 480 - AD 1087. Badr al-Din al-Jamali, minister of the
          Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir, undertook the expansion of the city on the
          northern and southern ends, for a distance of 150 m. He built the new
          walls out of stone and the north wall butted on to the northeastern wall
          of the mosque, Cairo, Egypt. built by order of Caliph al-Aziz bi Allah
          (r. AH 365–86 / AD 975–96) and after him,<strong>Note:</strong> But he
          died before completing it, so his son Al-Hakim completed it, by the
          command of God 403 AH (1012-1013 AD), so it was attributed to him and
          became known as Al-Hakim Mosque.

          The principle (northwestern) façade of the mosque extends along al-Muizz
        Street. The centre of this façade is marked by a projecting monumental
        portal composed of two squat towers that flank the entrance to the
        mosque. The entrance is ornamented by recessed panels filled with bands
        of decorative motifs, and kufic inscriptions. This type of decorative
        style was introduced to Egypt by the Fatimids and originated in North
        Africa. The projecting portal of the Mosque of al-Hakim bi Amrillah is
        considered to be one of the oldest examples in Egypt, an architectural
        style that had appeared before in the Mahdiyya Great Mosque in Tunisia
        {AH 308 - AD 921}.At the two ends of the principle façade are two
        minarets that are the work of al- Hakim bi-Amrillah, who had them built
        in AH 393 / AD 1002, The original section of the northern minaret is the
        base and the cylindrical body. The southwestern minaret is composed of a
        square base ending in an octagonal form. The remaining parts of the two
        minarets were added by Commander Baybars al-Gashanqir during the rule of
        the Mamluk sultan, al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun, after an earthquake in
        AH 703 / AD 1303, which resulted in the destruction of the original
        pinnacles of the two minarets..The French used the mosque as a fortress
        during their campaign against Egypt (AH 1213–16 / AD 1798–1801) and used
        the minarets as watch-towers. After that, it was occupied by glassmakers
        and textile-workers. A complete restoration of this mosque took place at
        the end of the 20th century.
