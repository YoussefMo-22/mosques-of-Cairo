        <p class="paragraph">
          After the Arab Islamic conquest, the representatives of Egypt ruled
          after the Islamic conquest and ruled it on behalf of the caliph in the
          capital of the Islamic state in Medina. This period lasted from the
          Islamic conquest in the year 20 AH until 254 AH when the Tulunid state
          began. This period was called the age of deputies, the "era of
          loyalty". During this period the Islamic state ruled by the Rightly
          Guided Caliphs was as follows: - The rule of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab 13-23
          AH. - The rule of Othman bin Affan 23-35 AH. - Ali bin Abi Talib era
          35-40 AH. After the end of the Rashidun rule, the Umayyad state was
          The rule of the Islamic State began in the year 40 AH until its fall
          In the year 132 AH. The Umayyad state was defeated by the Abbasid
          armies in 132 AH, and the Abbasid state ruled the Islamic world. .
          During the Abbasid state: Egypt was ruled by an ambitious prince on
          behalf of his deputy in the year 254 AH. This prince started to take
          real steps to make Egypt an independent city. He succeeded in
          achieving his goal of declaring a new era of Egyptian history. As soon
          as the Tulunid state began, Egypt entered a new era called the period
          of the independent states, the era of the resigned Diwali.

        <h3 class="head">The History of the Tulunid state [254 - 290 AH]</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The origins of the Tulunid family are Turkish. That this state was
          attributed to Toulon, who was a Turkish slave of Noah Al-Samani, the
          governor of Bukhara. The ruler of Bukhara provided a number of slaves
          - Including Toulon - as a gift to the Abbasid Mamun Succession. Tulun
          was promoted to Amir and his son Ahmed was born in Baghdad in 220 AH.
          Ahmed Ibn Tulun received a good education next to the throne of the
          Abbasid caliph. Ibn Tulun extracted his colleagues from the Mamluks
          until he earned the trust of the Abbasid caliph. After the death of
          his father, Tulun, the Abbasid caliph assumed all the positions that
          had belonged to his father. . In the year 254 AH. The Abbasid caliph
          al-Mu'tazz appointed the Turkish leader Qubak as deputy for Egypt, but
          he preferred to remain next to the throne of the caliphate. He chose
          Ibn Tulun to be the ruler of Egypt one day on his behalf and supported
          him with a great army which entered Egypt in the same year. Ibn Tulun
          began to rule Egypt and overcame all the obstacles that confronted
          him. Obstacles that faced Ibn Tulun The first obstacle that Ibn Tulun
          faced in Egypt was the postal worker who directed his loyalty to the
          caliph and not to the caliph. ruler of Egypt. The postal worker during
          this period was called Shakir, and he was a slave to Umm Al-Moataz.
          Skair realized the danger of Ibn Tulun early on Abbasid caliphate and
          send a message to the caliph to warn for him. Ibn Tulun acquired the
          message and took real steps to remove the postal worker from his
          position, and he succeeded in that In his own net after the death of
          Al-Moataz. . By deposing Shakir from his position, Ibn Tulun keeps his
          secrets inside his city. The second obstacle represented in the taxes
          worker 'amil al-Kharaj who was called ibn al- Mudabbir, that the
          caliphate used to separate the kharaj affairs on the political rule.
          The kharaj worker imposed many taxes on the people, so the
          relationship between him, the ruler and the people was deteriorated.
          Ibn Tulun managed to isolate ibn al-Mudabbir from his position. The
          following events served Ibn Tulun that Bakbak was dead and his
          position moved to Yargog who was a father-in-law of Ibn Tulun.

        <h3 class="head">Egypt under the Ikhshidid state [323 - 358 AH]</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          After the fall of the Tulunid state in 292 AH. Egypt became again
          following the Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad until the year 323 AH when
          the Abbasid caliph appointed the Amir Muhammad ibn Tughj as a ruler on
          it. The origin of this family was Turkish from Firghnah. The grand
          father of Muhammad ibn Tughj -Jiff- came from Firghanah to Samarra in
          reign of the caliph al-Mo'tasim. After the death of jiff, his son
          Tughj connected with Ibn Tulun and became one of his greatest leaders.
          Egypt under the Ikhshidid state Tughj passed away in 294 AH and his
          son Mohamed inherited the position of his father until he appointed as
          a ruler on Egypt by the order of al-Qahir in 321 AH and continued for
          only 32 days. Mohmed ibn Tughj again appointed as a ruler over Egypt
          in 323 AH by the order of the caliph al-Radi, this time, his rule
          continued for 11 years and he asked the caliph to donate him the
          nickname al-Ikhsid which means in Firghanah malik al-miluk. Al-Ikhside
          takes the same steps of the Tulunids as he made Egypt an independent
          state. Egypt under the Ikhshidid state Firstly, al-Ikhshid assumed
          only the political affairs whereas the kharaj was in the hand of the
          abbasid vizier Ga'far ibn al-Furat who spend one year in Egypt during
          the rule of al-Ikhshid and then traveled to Baghdad. After that
          al-Ikhshid gathered the political and the kharaj affairs to begin his
          real independence from the caliphate. The relationship between
          al-Ikhshid and the caliphate During the rule of al-Ikhshid, the
          Abbasid caliphate began to weaken as the caliphs forced to find a new
          position in the caliphate called amir al-Umara who had the real power
          in the caliphate. In 324 AH, ibn Ra'iq assumed this position, he asked
          al-Ikhshid to send more money to the caliphate which strained the
          relation between them. Ibn Ra'iq attempted to extract the Levant from
          al-Ikhshid but al-Ikhshid defeated his army and fixed his rule in
          Egypt and the Levant.
