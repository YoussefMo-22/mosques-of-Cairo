            The al-Rifa'i Mosque, located in Salah al-Din Square (or Maydan
            al-Qal'a, Citadel Square), was built in the 19th century and
            resembles the neighboring mosque of al-Sultan Ḥassan in the 14th
            century. The mosque is named after the tomb of Ali, the grandson of
            Imam Ahmad al-Rifay, known as 'Abu Sheybaq'. When the mosque was
            completed, it was directly attributed to Ahmad al-Rifay, who founded
            the Rifai Sufi Order. Although he was never buried here, the mosque
            hosts a joyful annual Sufi celebration to mark his birth. The
            original structure was a Fatimid mosque that was converted into a
            shrine to Ali Abu Sheybaq. finally, Khedive Ismail's mother, her
            Hoshiyar Hanim, commissioned the design of the current mosque and
            commissioned architect Hussein Pasha Fahmi to build it. Part of the
            plan included a mausoleum for Muhammad Ali's family as part of the
            extension, which was constructed with building materials imported
            from Europe, including Italian marble. Construction was suspended
            for years until it was completed in 1330 AD in the area of ​​Kedib
            Abbashelmi his II. Part of the mosque is dedicated to prayer, while
            another is reserved for the family of Muhammad, his Ali, and his
            Pasha, who ruled from the early 19th century until his 1953 when the
            modern Egyptian Republic was born. It has been. Kedib Ismail and his
            mother Hoshiyar Kadin, as well as the last two rulers of the
            Muhammad Ali dynasty, King Fuad I and King Farouk, are buried here,
            all in elaborate tombs. The mosque contains the burial chamber of
            Muhammad Reza Pahlavi (d. 1400 AH/1980 AD), the last Shah of Iran.

        <div class="bo1">
          <p class="p2">
            The architectural design of the Al Rifai Mosque is as interesting as
            its architectural history. Visitors are amazed by the intricate
            decoration of the exterior walls and the heavy pillars of the outer
            gate. The minaret stands out for its beauty and grace. In addition,
            cement was used in the construction of a mosque for the first time
            in an Islamic building in Egypt, indicating the transition to modern
            times. This monument represents a turning point in Egypt's cultural
            and political history. It deals with straight boulevards and
            squares, two aspects of European urban planning introduced during
            the reign of Muhammad Ali and his successors, who sought to
            transform Egypt's traditional society into a cosmopolitan society.
            Conceived as a stand-alone monument, Al-Rifay Mosque responds to its
            location by presenting four fully articulated façades along with
            ornate domes and Mamluk-style minarets. The mosque is an
            architectural expression of the dynasty's renewed quest for
            legitimacy through the use of national symbols. The mosque's
            association with Mamluk heritage is evident in its admirable
            imitation of the adjacent Sultan Hassan his mosque in mass, material
            use, color and detail. Its integration into the context of the
            popular city of Zawiya is a clear sign of the dynasty's desire to
            appeal to much-needed popular support in the face of increasing
            British rule.
